# American Options Pricing Using Neural Networks
### Introduction
In this repository, we explore the application of various neural network models to accurately predict American options prices. American options, known for their flexible exercise terms, present a unique challenge in financial modeling. This project aims to bridge the gap in conventional models with advanced neural network techniques, offering a more nuanced understanding of these complex financial instruments.

### About the Research Paper
The accompanying research paper delves into the use of neural networks in financial markets, specifically for predicting American call option prices. It compares several neural network models, including Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Modular Neural Networks (MNNs), against traditional methods like the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (B-AW) approximation. The paper can be found in the repository as American Options Pricing Using Neural Networks.pdf.
